    "# Predicting the NBA Draft\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to our tutorial! In this project, the goal is to look at what factors are the most important for NBA draft picks. First, a little bit about the NBA. The National Basketball Association, or NBA, is the highest level professional basketball league in the world. It is composed of 30 teams that play 82 games each, before a playoff bracket is set. The most common way for players to enter the league (After 2006, read more about the rule change [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eligibility_for_the_NBA_draft)) is to be drafted in the NBA draft. The draft consists of 2 rounds, with each team getting 1 pick per round, for a total of 60 picks. \n",
    "\n",
    "The end goal of this project is to try and predict the [2021 NBA draft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_NBA_draft) that will take place on July 29th. Finding out the position of draft picks would be useful for those in the sports industry. A team would be able to predict what players other teams will select, see if players are over/under-rated, or possibly help set sports betting odds. However to start predicting the draft, we must look at past drafts to see what are the most important factors for an NBA draft pick. The project will be broken up into 3 sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Wrangling\n",
    "2. Analysis of Previous Drafts\n",
    "3. Predictions of 2021 Draft\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the course of this guide, we hope the reader is able to understand how and why data analysis is done, and would be able to follow similar steps to do some data science on other topics!"

    "Perhaps the most important part is to get the data. This first dataset needed is a collection of past NBA draft picks college stats. This is what we will do analysis on, and train our machine learning model on. We found the website [barttorvik.com](https://www.barttorvik.com/playerstat.php?link=y&minGP=15&year=all&start=-11101&end=all0501) that contains an interactive table with college players and their stats. To get the players we wanted, the website allowed us to query all players since 2008 that were drafted (set drafted to <= 60). *More about this later....*\n",

But if either of you know a better way to import the data, please do it that way/tell me and I can fix it, because copy/pasting is definitely not the best."
